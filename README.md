# Astar_Advanced_C_Project
Astar algorithm implemented using C. This is the final project of Advanced C class which is a part of Specialization Semester of Masters of Software Engineering at EPITA, Paris.

# Starter code provided
At the beginning of the project, starter code is provided for h file of List and pseudo code of A* algorithm

# Work done
## First Stage: List.c
First stage of the project is to implement the List.c file based on the List.h file provided 
* This part is bonus mark. 

## Second Stage: File reading 
The hardest part of the project is to read data from `projectData/FRANCE.MAP` into a List of cities each with a List neighbours. File/data structure handling is the main test point of this project. 
It took me a while to actually figure out the structure of the map which is a list of list.  

## Third Stage: A* algorithm
It turned out to be easier than was thought. As the professor has provided the pseudo code, you just need to be really careful playing with pointers.
